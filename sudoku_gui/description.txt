This was a hobby project of mine. This program executes a game of sudoku and I have implemented a GUI for it.

User can define the seed which will generate a sudoku board and user can specify how many numbers are shown to begin with. If 
user wants to see the solution, they can press solve and solved sudoku board will be shown.

If user choses seed to be 0, program will not generate a board but user can put numbers on the board. When user hits solve, the 
program will give a solution to the sudoku board which was given by the user.
