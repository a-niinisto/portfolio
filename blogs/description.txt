Blogs is a program I made on course Fullstack Open. It executes a web page where user can upload their own blogs and other users
have the possibility to give them a like. Blogs are uploaded to and downloaded from MongoDB database. Only users who have logged
in can upload or like blogs. User information is also stored in MongoDB. Users have been manually added: sign up capability is yet
to be implemented. Connection to the MongoDB is not possible without my password, so program cannot be executed properly.
